This is a repository in which the epidemiological models SIR and that of the film "I am legend" are studied.

SIR model: Simple model that considers susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R).

Each file explores the dynamics of the system in relation to the variable indicated by the file name. That is, the dynamics are studied with changes in beta (beta.py), gamma (gamma.py), both beta and gamma (gamma_beta.py), population size (npopulation.py) and the course of time (SIRdays.py). In addition, the model is extended to include demographic (SIR_demografia.py) and vaccination effects (SIR_vaccine.py and SIR_vaccine_2.py). 
Finally, a study of the epidemiological model presented in the film "I am a legend", both with (im_leyend.py) and without vaccination (im_leyend_vaccine.py), is carried out.
